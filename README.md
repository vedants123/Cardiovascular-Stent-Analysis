Structural analysis was performed on a steel stent in Ansys Mechanical Static Structural post meshing. Only one symmetric part of the geometry was simulated to save on resources. Initially, a fine mesh was created but due to lack of poweful computational resources, the mesh size was reduced. Displacement was given in the cylindrical coordinate system and Von-Mises Stresses and Deformation was obtained.
